MAIN STEPS

Step 1: Setup the project structure
Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice
Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice
Step 4: Declare the players score variables
Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round
Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game


PLANNING

# Step 1: Setup the project structure


# Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice

// Subtasks

Create a new function named getComputerChoice

    Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number 
    that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. 
    Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.

Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of 
the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

// Pseudocode

CREATE function getComputerChoice()

CREATE randomInt to store random integer 

IF randomInt equals to 0:
    RETURN "rock"
ELSE IF randomInt equals to 1:
    RETURN "paper"
ELSE:
    RETURN "scissors"

CHECK RETURN value on console


# Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice

// Subtasks

Create a new function named getHumanChoice

Write the code so that getHumanChoice will return one of 
the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.

    Hint: Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.
    You do not need to handle reprompting if the user 
    enters an invalid input, as that would require 
    things we will teach later. For now, just assume 
    the user will always enter a valid choice.

// Pseudocode

CREATE function getHumanChoice

CREATE variable userInput to store user’s input
PROMPT the user for input AND store it in userInput

RETURN userInput 

CHECK RETURN value on console 
 

# Step 4: Declare the players score variables

// Subtasks

Create two new variables named humanScore and 
computerScore in the global scope.

Initialize those variables with the value of 0.

// Pseudocode

CREATE variable humanScore in global scope with initial value of 0
CREATE variable computerScore in global scope initial value of 0
