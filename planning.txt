# Write the logic to get the computer choice

    #Write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

    Create a new function named getComputerChoice
        Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number 
        that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. 
        Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.

    Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of 
    the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

// Pseudocode

CREATE randomInt to store random integer 

IF randomInt equals to 0:
    Return "rock"
ELSE IF randomInt equals to 1:
    Return "paper"
ELSE 
    Return "scissors"

CHECK return value on console
