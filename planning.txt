In our UI, the player should be able to play 
the game by clicking on buttons

# MAIN STEPS

1. Remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds

2. Create three buttons, one for each selection

3. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your 
playRound function with the correct playerSelection 
every time a button is clicked

4. Add a div for displaying results and change 
all of your console.logs into DOM methods

5. Display the running score, and 
announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
